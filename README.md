## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Daily Challenge System

#### How It Works

1. **Challenge Generation**

   - Each day, a new challenge is created
   - Challenge type: Match player to stats
   - Stats are randomly selected from current Pacers players

2. **Player Progression**

   - User reads stats: "20.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 10.8 APG"
   - User selects from 4 player options
   - If correct: +10-50 points (random)
   - If incorrect: Challenge can be retried

3. **Points Earned**

   - Points stored in user's Firestore document
   - Points update in real-time across all pages
   - Contributes to leaderboard ranking

4. **Modal Feedback**
   - Shows "Challenge Complete!" modal
   - Displays points earned
   - Shows newly unlocked players (if any)
   - Displays reward toast notification

### Player Unlock System

#### Unlock Tiers

Players are locked by performance tier:

| Tier | PPG Range | Players                 | Points Required |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| 1    | 20+ PPG   | Haliburton, Siakam      | 200             |
| 2    | 14-20 PPG | Mathurin                | 150             |
| 3    | 10-14 PPG | Nesmith, Quenton        | 100             |
| 4    | 5-10 PPG  | Toppin, Huff, McConnell | 50              |
| 5    | <5 PPG    | Others                  | Free (0)        |

#### Unlock Mechanics

- **Automatic Unlocking**: When user reaches required points, player is automatically unlocked
- **Visual Indicators**: Locked players show 🔒 badge on player cards
- **Unlock Notification**: Gold-bordered box shows "YOU HAVE UNLOCKED THESE PLAYERS!" with player names
- **Progress Persistence**: Unlocked status saved to both localStorage and Firestore

#### Example Progression

```
User starts: 0 points, 0 players unlocked
Complete challenge: +15 points (15 total)
Complete challenge: +25 points (40 total)
Complete challenge: +35 points (75 total)
Complete challenge: +30 points (105 total)
  → Aaron Nesmith UNLOCKED! 🎉
Complete challenges: +50 points (155 total)
  → Benedict Mathurin UNLOCKED! 🎉
```

### Reward System

#### Reward Types

1. **First Win** - Complete your first challenge
2. **Milestone Rewards** - Every 50 points
3. **Player Unlock Bonus** - When unlocking premium players
4. **Daily Streak** - Complete challenges on consecutive days

#### Reward Display

- **Toast Notification**: Bottom-right corner
- **Animation**: Slides in from right, displays for 4 seconds
- **Sound**: Optional notification sound (can be enabled)
- **Rewards Page**: View all collected rewards with dates and descriptions

## 🚀 Deployment

### Option 1: Firebase App Hosting (Recommended) ⭐

Firebase
App Hosting is a fully managed hosting platform that provides automatic deployments, free SSL certificates, CDN distribution, and seamless Firebase integration.

#### Why Firebase App Hosting?

- **Automatic Deployments** - Deploy directly from GitHub
- **Zero Configuration SSL** - HTTPS by default
- **Global CDN** - Fast content delivery worldwide
- **Firebase Integration** - Direct access to Firestore, Auth, Storage
- **Free Tier** - Up to 180 build minutes/month
- **Environment Variables** - Secure secret management
- **Preview URLs** - Test PRs before merging
- **Auto Rollback** - Revert failed deployments instantly

#### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with your repository
- Firebase project (n423-6048d)
- Firebase CLI installed

#### Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository

1. **Go to Firebase Console**

   - Visit https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select your project (n423-6048d)
   - Go to Build > App Hosting

2. **Click "Create Repository Connection"**

   - Select "GitHub" as source
   - Authorize Firebase to access your GitHub account
   - Select your repository: `n423DreamTeam/dreamTeamPRT2Laptop`
   - Select branch: `main` (or your production branch)

3. **Confirm Permissions**
   - Firebase needs permission to:
     - Push commits for automatic deployments
     - Monitor pull requests for preview deployments
     - Read your repository contents

#### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

1. **In Firebase Console, set Build Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   Runtime: Node.js 20
   Build Command: npm run build
   Output Directory: dist
   ```

2. **Key Configuration Details:**
   - **Runtime**: Node.js 20 (supports ES modules)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` compiles your Vite app
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/` (where Vite outputs production build)
   - **Environment Variables**: Set in next step

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

1. **In App Hosting Settings, add these secrets:**

   ```
   VITE_API_URL = http://localhost:3001
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = your_firebase_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = n423-6048d
   BALL_DONT_LIE_API_KEY = your_ball_dont_lie_key
   ```

2. **For Production (different from development):**

   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-api-server.com
   ```

3. **Add secrets via Firebase CLI:**
   ```bash
   firebase apphosting:secrets:set BALL_DONT_LIE_API_KEY
   # Follow prompts to enter your API key
   ```

#### Step 4: Configure Cloud Functions (Backend API)

Your `api.js` needs to run as a Cloud Function for the backend:

1. **Create Cloud Function wrapper** (`functions/api.js`):

   ```javascript
   const functions = require("firebase-functions");
   const express = require("express");
   const cors = require("cors");
   const fetch = require("node-fetch");

   const app = express();
   app.use(cors());

   const API_KEY = process.env.BALL_DONT_LIE_API_KEY;

   app.get("/api/players", async (req, res) => {
     const teamId = req.query.team_id || 12;
     try {
       const response = await fetch(
         `https://api.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players?team_ids[]=${teamId}`,
         { headers: { Authorization: API_KEY } }
       );
       const data = await response.json();
       res.json(data);
     } catch (err) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
     }
   });

   exports.api = functions.https.onRequest(app);
   ```

2. **Update `functions/package.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "name": "functions",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "dependencies": {
       "firebase-functions": "^4.7.0",
       "firebase-admin": "^12.0.0",
       "express": "^4.18.2",
       "cors": "^2.8.5",
       "node-fetch": "^2.6.7"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```

#### Step 5: Update firebase.json

Configure your deployment settings:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "/api/**",
        "function": "api"
      },
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions",
    "runtime": "node20"
  },
  "apphosting": {
    "locations": {
      "us-east1": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 6: Deploy

**First Time Deployment:**

```bash
firebase deploy
```

**Automatic Deployments (via GitHub):**

- Any push to `main` automatically deploys
- PRs get preview URLs automatically
- No manual deployment needed!

**Manual Deployment (if needed):**

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

#### Step 7: Access Your Site

After deployment completes:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**

   - Build > App Hosting
   - Copy your URL (format: `https://n423-6048d-default.firebaseapp.com`)

2. **Or Find in CLI Output:**

   ```

### Option 2: Traditional Firebase Hosting

If you only want frontend hosting (without backend):

#### Setup

1. **Build the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Firebase**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

3. **Your site will be available at:**
   ```
   https://n423-6048d.web.app
   ```

#### Backend API Considerations

- You must host the API separately (Heroku, Render, Railway, etc.)
- Update `api.js` to use your hosted API URL
- Configure CORS headers in `api.js`

---

### Option 3: Docker + Cloud Run

For advanced setups with custom backend:

1. **Create Dockerfile:**

   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:20
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   RUN npm run build
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "run", "api"]
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloud Run:**
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy dreamteam-api \
     --source . \
     --platform managed \
     --region us-east1
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Failed to edit message: Missing or insufficient permissions"

**Cause**: Firestore rules don't allow message updates

**Solution**:

- Verify `firestore.rules` has correct update permission:
  ```
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
  ```
- Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

#### 2. "Cannot read property 'firebase' of undefined"

**Cause**: Firebase not initialized before use

**Solution**:

- Ensure `src/main.js` is loaded before other scripts
- Check browser console for initialization errors
- Verify Firebase config is correct

#### 3. "401 Unauthorized" from Ball Don't Lie API

**Cause**: Invalid or missing API key

**Solution**:

- Go to https://balldontlie.io/api
- Generate a new API key
- Update `api.js` with new key
- Restart API server: `npm run api`

#### 4. Players Not Loading in Dashboard

**Cause**: API server not running or CORS issue

**Solution**:

- Start API server: `npm run api`
- Verify server is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for network errors
- Verify Ball Don't Lie API key is valid

#### 5. "Cannot connect to localhost:3001"

**Cause**: API server not started

**Solution**:

- Run: `npm run api`
- Wait for "Server running on port 3001" message
- Verify no other app is using port 3001
- Try: `lsof -i :3001` (Mac/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :3001` (Windows)

#### 6. Chat Messages Not Showing

**Cause**: Firestore permissions or real-time listener issue

**Solution**:

- Check Firestore security rules allow `read: if true;` for messages
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache and localStorage

#### 7. Styles Not Updating

**Cause**: SCSS not compiled to CSS

**Solution**:

- Compile SCSS: `npm run compile-sass`
- Make sure `src/css/styles.css` is up to date
- Check that CSS is linked in HTML: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/css/styles.css">`
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in browser console:

```javascript
// Add to main.js
window.DEBUG = true;

// In chat.js
if (window.DEBUG) console.log("Debug info...");
```

### Performance Issues

**Slow Page Load**

- Check Firebase Firestore query indexes
- Optimize image sizes
- Use browser DevTools Performance tab

**High CPU/Memory**

- Limit real-time listeners (onSnapshot)
- Paginate large data sets
- Unload unused pages
